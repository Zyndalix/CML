# Coornhert Modelling Language
Made by Bram, Ferry & Ioan

This is a desktop app where the Coornhert Modelling Language can be written and executed. While this whole project is written from scratch, the idea is based on an existing implementation of the modelling language, written by Tom Kooij. See https://github.com/tomkooij/modelleertaal for more info.
