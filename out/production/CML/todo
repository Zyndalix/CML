User Interface:
	- Text box where the user can input code
	- Text box where the user inputs the amount of runs
	- Buttons like 'Run'
	
	- Layout:
	-------------------------------------
	|				|			|		|
	| 	Graph		|	Rules	| Vars  |
	|				|			|		|
	|				|			|		|
	-------------------------------------
	|				|					|
	|	Errors		|	Advanced Box:	|
	|				|	Show AST		|

	-------------------------------------

	Eventually:
	- Syntax highlighting

Graph:
	- find suitable graphing lib -> JFreeChart
	- add functions to change graphs according to UI (choose variables to graph, change scale of graph)
	
Interpreter (eventually):
	- nested if statements
	- if else statements
	- multiple rules in if-body
	
	- NodeGroup class for grouping nodes in if-body and all nodes in variableList and ruleList
